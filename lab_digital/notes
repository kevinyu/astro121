### Using DFEC
import DFEC

# SRS Function Generator
DFEC.set_srs
 freq: Set LO frequency
 vpp: Set amplitude in volts
 off: Set DC offset
 pha: Set phase offset


# Sampling
DFEC.sampler
 nSamp: number of samples
 freqSamp: sampling frequency in Hz

>>> data = DFEC.sampler(1e3, 1e7)  # acquired data


Numpy has a builtin function called savez which saves arrays into a single file
>>> np.savez("mixer_data.npz", data)  # saves array to file
>>> F = np.load("mixer_data.npz")
>>> F.files
['arr_0']
>>> data = F["arr_0"]  # get data back out of npz
